        <p class="lead mb-4">I work part-time at Busy Bees Education in San Bernardino County, and I would be there for ten to twelve hours per week. My primary goal as a future educator is to accumulate experience teaching children of all ages while also earning a wage that will support my basic living expenditures and housing costs. The majority of kids attend this educational institution to learn foreign languages that they may not have chance to learn in regular school time, strengthen their academic foundations, and receive effective after-school tutoring. Under the guidance of experienced teachers, I teach a variety of subjects to students who are from pre-k to elementary school. I mainly work as a Chinese instructor, where I teach Chinese bilingually to help non-native speakers better understand a foreign language. To boost students' interest in Pinyin and Chinese characters, I design interesting stories and activities. For instance, paper cutting, bingo games, word-picture matching, and so on. I am also responsible for monitoring kids' conduct and keeping the classroom clean and organized. Additionally, I tutor elementary school students with their homework in math, reading, and the arts after school. I assist them in completing their assignments in the allotted time and send them to the next class. I occasionally work as an English and Math substitute teacher. I stay in contact with other teachers on a regular basis so that I may prepare appropriate learning materials to pass out before class. In kidsâ€™ rest time, I will lead them to do yoga in the dancing room, do physical activities in the playground, play with blocks and crafting, etc. My problem-solving skills, organizational and planning skills have all improved as a result of these experiences. Simultaneously, it has significantly enhanced my patience and passion for kids.<br><br>

        Iâ€™m a member of the Advertising Department at UCR CSSA (Chinese Students and Scholars Association) in the school year of 2021 and 2022. As its name implies, it is an official non-profit organization that is responsible for assisting Chinese students who are studying, working, or living away from home together on campus, functioning as a bridge between Chinese and other communities. My main job is to advertise different activities held by CSSA on different social media, planning and executing activities in collaboration with other departments. We will hold activities like annual Chinese New Year banquets, holiday parties, academic conferences, talent recruiting competitions, etc. I write articles on social media to promote CSSA events. I assist students with academic concerns and information collection on the UCR campus. l will also design posters, certificates, and marketing promotion information for the public image of the organization.<br><br>

        The Language Circle Program at UCR is to provide non-native speakers who desire to learn a foreign language the opportunity to engage with native speakers and to study in an immersive environment, therefore enhancing their oral skills and self-confidence. This program offers English, Spanish, Chinese, French, Korean, Japanese Circle, I was volunteering to be the host and the moderator of Chinese Circle in the school year of 2021 on Tuesdays. Although I'm a native Chinese speaker, if peers who participated have difficulty understanding throughout the conversation, I may speak fluent English to help them in explaining words' meanings. My job in the activity each time is to make a list of topics to talk about prior to the day, come up with some fascinating themes to talk about during the activity, correct their pronunciation and grammatical errors, give appropriate encouragement and support, and keep track of the attendees' names and details on the sign-in sheet. My biggest gain from this pleasant experience is that I have made a lot of very good friends and had an excellent connection with schools and students. I can better integrate into the school and community by sharing my language and propagating the culture.
